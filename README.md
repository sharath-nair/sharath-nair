## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I am a frontend engineer with over a decade of IT experience, including 7 years in web development and 3 years in the web3/crypto space.
- I have led and contributed to projects that drove significant growth, such as a DeFi protocol that saw a 6000% increase in total volume. ðŸŒ±
- I excel at creating seamless user experiences, collaborating with cross-functional teams, and mentoring peers to achieve high-quality results.
- With over 5 years of remote work experience, I am adept at working independently and excelling in distributed teams. I am particularly keen on exploring the practical applications of blockchain technology, as I believe decentralization will play a pivotal role in the future.
